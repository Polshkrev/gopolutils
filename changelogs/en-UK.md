    - Added mention of the new getter and setter methods for the `level` and `name` property in `logger.md`.

`Changed`

    - The `SetLevel` function now simply sets the level of the logger rather than checking if the parametre and property are the same.
## v1.10.1 - 2025-01-12
`Fixed`
- `fayl`
    - `Read` now uses the abosulte path instead of just obtaining the suffix of the path parametre.
## v1.10.0 - 2025-01-11: The Serialization Update
`Added`
- Added the `goserialize` dependency.
- Added `meta.toml`.
- `Exception`
    - A new public getter for the message property has been added.
    - A new public getter for the name property has been added.
- `Docs`
    - Deprecation notices for the types in the `fayl` package were added.

`Changed`
- `fayl`
    - All the public functions now take in a `Path` struct rather than just a string.
    - The private functions `readRawObject`, `readRawList`, and `readerListDispatch` now use the `Path` struct.
    - The private functions `readRawObject` and `readRawList` now take in a `goserialize.Reader` instead of the **now depricated** internal `Reader` type.
    - The private function `readerListDispatch` and the public function `ReadObject` now use the suffix of the given `Path` struct instead of using the **now depricated** `getFileType` internal function that takes in a string.
    - If the `Read` function fails, the error message uses the new `Message` method from the `Exception` struct instead of the full `Error` method. This is simply a formatting clarification.
    - The private function `readerListDispatch` and the public function `ReadObject` now uses the appropriate `goserialize.Reader` within the function. I.e `goserialize.JSONReader` for a JSON file type.

`Deprecated`
- `fayl`
    - Due to the introduction of the `goserialize` dependency, all the type aliases in the `read.go` file have been deprecated.
