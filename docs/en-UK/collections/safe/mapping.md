# Mapping

Interface to standardize a concurrent-safe key-value pair data structure. This interface is very similar to the [Collection](/docs/en-UK/collections/collection.md) interface. This interface implements the [View](/docs/en-UK/collections/view.md) and [Sized](/docs/en-UK/collections/sized.md) interfaces.
